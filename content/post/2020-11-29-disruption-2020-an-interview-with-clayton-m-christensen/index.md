Clay was more interested in getting to the right answer than in being right. And for him, getting to the right answer started with asking the right questions.  For instance:  

- What does the ascendance of a new generation of straight-to-consumer disrupters tell us about how innovation is evolving? 
- What are the sources of disruption that every com- pany must monitor? 
- Is disruption always the right strategy — or not?
-  Why have companies not gotten better at solving the innovator’s dilemma two decades after Clay first helped us understand how disruption occurs? 

How would you like to define disruptive innovation for the record? 

CLAYTON M. CHRISTENSEN: Disruptive innovation describes a process by which a product or service powered by a technology enabler initially takes root in simple applications at the low end of a market — typically by being less expensive and more accessible — and then relentlessly moves upmarket, eventually displacing established competitors. Disruptive innovations are not breakthrough innovations or “ambitious upstarts” that dramatically alter how business is done but, rather, consist of products and services that are simple, accessible, and affordable. These products and services often appear modest at their outset but over time have the potential to transform an industry.  

The Prosperity Paradox, we describe three types of innovation, all of which have a different impact on the growth of a firm and — by extension — a nation. 

1. Sustaining innovation, which most understand, is the process of making good products better. 
2. efficiency innovation, which is when a company tries to do more with less. By their very nature
3. market-creating innovations, meaning they build a new market for new customers. 

These innovations are the source of growth in any economy, as they pull in resources, investment, operations, employees, and infrastructure in order to serve this larger population of customers. 

Does the rise of “digital transformation” present any anomalies to your theories? 

CHRISTENSEN: Certainly there are anomalies wait- ing to be discovered, and further research into digital-focused firms will yield profound insight into the boundaries of disruptive innovation theory. But I believe that the fundamental questions we’ve been asking for decades now apply just as much in a digital context as they do in an analog one. 

- Who are your best customers? 
- What is your organization capable or incapable of doing? 
- What “jobs” are you trying to help customers get done in their lives? 
- In what circumstances should you integrate, and in what circumstances should you modularize your firm’s and product’s architecture? 
- Who are the non- consumers, and what is limiting their access? 
These strategic questions are universal. 

And in my experience, it seems that it’s often easier for executives to spot disruptions occurring in someone else’s industry rather than their own, where their deep and nuanced knowledge can sometimes distract them from seeing the writing on the wall. That’s why theory is so important. The theory predicts what will happen without being clouded by personal opinion. I don’t have an opinion on whether a particular company is vulnerable to disruption or not — but the theory does. That’s why it’s such a powerful tool. 

Your Theory of Jobs to Be Done explains how a would-be disrupter nails the right product or offering when an incumbent often can’t get it right. Can you explain what this is and why it’s so powerful? 
CHRISTENSEN: My colleagues and I have spent years trying to understand customer behavior — why someone would choose to buy one product or service over other options. What we know is that most companies tend to focus on data to help guide their decisions: They know market share to the nth degree, how products are selling in different mar- kets, profit margin across hundreds of different items, and so on. But all this data is focused on customers and the product itself — not what the customer is trying to accomplish in making the purchase. We believe that there’s a better way to understand that choice. We call it the Theory of Jobs to Be Done. 

There is a growing set of companies that seem to be more fluid in how they approach strategy — like Amazon, Alibaba, and Tencent. Are these 
companies inoculated against the innovator’s dilemma? CHRISTENSEN: This is a very interesting question. I am always wary when we hear that whatever is the high-flying company of the day has solved such a deep systemic problem. Remember, Sears, Digital Equipment Corp., and Eastman Kodak were all once hailed as paragons of good management, until circumstances changed. 

One of my former doctoral students, Howard Yu (who now teaches at IMD), noted how important what he called “CEO deep dives” are to wrestling with common innovation challenges, and all of these companies have had the good fortune to have leaders that are ready, willing, and able to do such deep dives. 

The question for each is, when growth inevitably slows, and when those founders inevitably move on, have they developed the systems, processes, and culture to keep that fluidity? Or, when circumstances change, will the story end the same way it did for other paragons of good management? We will learn something interesting either way. 

Your theories have provided guidance not only for the senior statesmen of Silicon Valley but for a new generation of entrepreneurs all around the world. And you may have reached a pop culture pinnacle when you were the answer to a Jeopardy! question a few years ago. But what is it that you would most like to be remembered for? 
CHRISTENSEN: I want to be remembered for my faith in God and my belief that he wants all of mankind to be successful. The only way to make this happen is to help individual people become better people, and innovation is the key to unlocking evermore opportunities to do that.
